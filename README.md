# P1 PEGA ROSA SHOPPER

# Project Description 
- An automated shopping bot ROSA extracts customers' shopping lists from SQL and shops for those items on the PEGA shopping platform. ROSA purchases the requested items on the PEGA platform using the customer's credit card information that is pulled from the customer index in SQL, sends a receipt to the customer in an automated email of their purchased items along with user fees, generates a profit sheet for all completed orders, and sends an automated email to the user.
